                In the Age of Ancients the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons. But then there was Fire and with fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course, light and dark. Then from the dark, They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame. Nito, the First of the Dead, The Witch of Izalith and her Daughters of Chaos, Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights. And the Furtive Pygmy, so easily forgotten

                    With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dragons. Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales. The Witches weaved great firestorms. Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease. And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the Dragons were no more.
                    
                    Thus began the Age of Fire. But soon the flames will fade and only Dark will remain. Even now there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights. And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign.
                    
                    Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead. And in this land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north, where they are locked away, to await the end of the world... This is your fate.

                        Dark Souls is a third-person action role-playing game. A core mechanic of the game is exploration.
                        Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative
                        areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open world environment, connected through 
                        a central hub area. The player character can travel between areas and explore various paths at will, although 
                        prerequisites have to be met to unlock certain areas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A central element to the gameplay of Dark Souls is the bonfire. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and 
                        serve as checkpoints for each level. By resting at a bonfire, the player character is healed to full and regains all 
                        of the healing charges of their "Estus Flask." They can also level up and perform other functions, such as attuning magic, 
                        and repairing and upgrading equipment. However, resting at a bonfire respawns all of the world's enemies, except for 
                        bosses, mini-bosses, and friendly non-playable characters. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The player character's interaction with the world of Dark Souls includes a great deal of combat. Combat includes melee attacks, various
                        forms of defensive maneuvering, and magical abilities. For melee attacks, player characters have access to a wide array of high fantasy
                        medieval-style weaponry—including swords, spears, and maces-as well as fantastical weaponry such as magical swords, huge greatswords, and
                        immense clubs. For defense, player characters have access to shields, armor, dodging, and parrying. For magic, which includes a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities known as sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies, player characters do not use any form of mana as in most other fantasy RPGs - instead, they gain a discrete number of uses for each attuned spell when resting at a bonfire. These various forms of combat all have tradeoffs, variations, and in-game costs associated
                        with them; and they can all be buffed or altered in some fashion through leveling, smithing, consumable items, magical rings, and new
                        equipment.

                <strong>The Warrior</strong> is one of the most well-rounded starting classes, with high Strength and Dexterity,
                allowing them to make use of a lot of the equipment they come across. They also start with a solid shield and an easy-to-use weapon, as well as fairly light armor that sacrifices Poise for mobility. 
                <br><br>
                Their balanced stats make them a good choice for new players, with their main disadvantage being their initial lack in
                the magic stats, forcing them to rely on melee attacks. For a player who does not wish to use any magic whatsoever, they are the optimal choice.

                <strong>The Knight</strong> is a tank class, and starts with the highest vitality value of all classes, as well as possessing the most robust equipment. 
                This, however, comes at the price of slower movement - although the player can remove their helmet and gauntlets to allow them to medium 
                roll at the start of the game without much defense loss. Due to their high Strength and Dexterity levels, Knights are able to easily equip most forms of weaponry, and their faith stat is high enough as to allow for Knights healing themselves with miracles. The Knight automatically begins the game in the Way of White covenant, but unlike the Cleric class, does not have access to the early-game miracles (unless they are bought from Petrus of Thorolund).
